\chapter{Conclusion and Future Scope}

In conclusion, our team feels that this is a project worth doing as it will help address the detection problem of the Wolff Parkinson White syndrome which even though is rare may prove to be fatal and thus address a worthwhile endeavour of reducing the probabilities of cardiac issues in the general demographic and assist the progress in the medical field. The different features provided by our application will help to create a system that provides for multiple assistance options such as detection, treatments, medical opinions and information dispersion. This project aims to eliminate problems faced by the current traditional process employed to detect the syndrome which is not automated and thus may lead to issues in detection and treatment of this syndrome. The functionalities in this application are to create a system that enforces simple and interactive options for symptoms detection, syndrome detection and treatments as well as other parameters.  

This project implements various machine learning models for detection of probability of symptoms which provide near accurate results for prediction of probability of presence of the Wolff Parkinson White syndrome. The project then implements neural networks for detection of the presence of Wolff Parkinson White syndrome detection as well as prediction the comprehensive after detection medications, treatments and referrals for medical centers for treatment.  

Future Scope:   
\begin{itemize}
	\item Genetic testing: WPW syndrome is a genetic condition that is often inherited. Genetic testing can identify individuals who carry the gene for WPW syndrome and may develop the condition later in life.  
	\item Wearable technology: Advances in wearable technology, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, may make it easier to detect abnormal heart rhythms associated with WPW syndrome in real-time.
	\item Telemedicine: Telemedicine has become increasingly popular in recent years, and it may be particularly useful for diagnosing and managing rare conditions like WPW syndrome. Remote consultations with specialists can help patients receive timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment. New imaging techniques: Advances in imaging technology, such as 3D echocardiography and cardiac CT/MRI, may provide more detailed images of the heart and improve the diagnosis and management of WPW syndrome.
