\begin{abstract}
  %\input{abstract}
%  Here is my introduction text. The section heading is in a large bold
%font and all sections and subsections are numbered.
%
%Type your main text in 12-point Times with 1.5 line spacing. Do not
%use double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica

%place any additional blank lines between paragraphs.

In the present day and age, we live in a world where anything and everything related to medical condition/syndrome detection and treatment has and continues to become extremely crucial. The dependency on all such systems has grown rapidly in the last few decades due to number of external factors, of the critical factor being these systemâ€™s capability and capacity of detecting diseases and syndromes or any other prevalent conditions well-in time. This offers patients the chance of exploring further options. These options depend on severity of detection if any, further course of treatment and other factors associated with the same. The team has developed a web application for analyzing ECGs of patients and detection of Wolff Parkinson White syndrome through irregular heartbeat and other pre-set parameters, in the process providing additional and useful information including symptoms, precautions and possible mode of treatments. Also, providing patients with connections to concerned health centers in the process of creating a one-stop solution for this syndrome.
